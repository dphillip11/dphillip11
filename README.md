Hi, I'm Daniel and this is a collection of my work. Predominantly this work has been completed as part of my ongoing self-education. I have completed projects related to algorithms, game development, web development and data science using Unity, Python, C , Lua, Love2d, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Django and Flask. I am currently working on a tile based platformer game using Love2D, please try it out and let me know what you think.
