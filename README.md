Hi, I'm Daniel and this is a collection of my work. I am engaged in continuing self education and currently use github to store my work. I have completed projects related to algorithms, game development, web development and data science using Unity, Python, C, Lua, Love2d, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Django and Flask. I have recently been focussed on learning about memory optimization and multithreading as well as working on a 2D platformer game in Unity.
