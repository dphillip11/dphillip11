### Hi, welcome to my github page.

Currently I am working on a game engine. You can see a preliminary example in the 3D_Physics repository. I am working on an ECS style registry in the hashed_vector repository I will be implementing this into a more architecturally thorough game engine implemented via webGPU.

*I have also worked on some shader coding https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ctBXDt.
*I have built some games and have more in the pipeline in Unity https://play.unity.com/u/dphillip11.
*You can also browse my repos to see some of the web development work I have done. If you want to collaborate, please get in touch. Further, if you want to offer me employment I will be over the moon to chat.

My email address is dphillip11@gmail.com.
