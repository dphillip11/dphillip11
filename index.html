                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    Hello! My journey in programming started during my <b>maths degree</b>, when I began to leverage
                    Python to
                    interpret
                    and display data. Intrigued by the power and potential of programming, I enrolled in the
                    <b>CS50x</b>
                    course.
                    This
                    immersive experience not only deepened my understanding but also sparked an enduring enthusiasm for
                    coding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since then, I've worked on diverse projects spanning <b>web development, game development, and
                        software
                        creation</b>,
                    harnessing a range of languages such as <b>C, C++, C#, Python, JavaScript and Lua</b>. I have also
                    gained
                    expertise in
                    <b>graphics
                        programming</b> with <b>OpenGL</b> and <b>GLSL</b>, developed games using <b>Love2D</b> and
                    <b>Unity</b>, and honed my skills in
                    <b>Object-Oriented
                        Programming (OOP)</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My exploration of the coding world didn't stop there. I delved into <b>data-oriented programming</b>
                    and
                    discovered new
                    ways to structure and interact with data. Currently, my primary language is C++, and I am
                    continuously
                    updating
                    my knowledge as new features are introduced. I regularly follow programming conferences such as
                    CppCon
                    to stay
                    abreast of best practices and innovations in the field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Programming, for me, is a journey of <b>continuous learning</b>, and I am excited to apply my skills
                    to new
                    challenges.

                    <h3>Description:</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Newton's Cradle Simulation is a web-based interactive simulation of the famous physics
                        experiment
                        known as Newton's Cradle. The simulation is built using HTML, CSS, and WebGL with the help of
                        JavaScript.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The webpage features a visually appealing interface where a virtual Newton's Cradle is
                        displayed. The
                        simulation utilizes a canvas element to render the 3D environment. The balls and supporting
                        frames are
                        created using WebGL and are dynamically positioned within the scene.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The user can interact with the simulation in several ways. Firstly, the camera can be controlled
                        using
                        the arrow keys, allowing the user to navigate around the virtual environment and observe the
                        physics
                        simulation from different angles. Additionally, the scroll wheel can be used to zoom in and out
                        of the
                        scene, providing a closer look at the objects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The simulation accurately replicates the behavior of the physical Newton's Cradle. The balls
                        swing back
                        and forth, demonstrating the principles of conservation of momentum and energy. The physics
                        calculations
                        are performed in real-time, allowing for a realistic and interactive experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To enhance the user experience, an information button is provided, which, when clicked, displays
                        a modal
                        with instructions on how to interact with the simulation. This provides users with guidance on
                        using the
                        arrow keys for camera control and scroll wheel for zooming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project demonstrates proficiency in web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and
                        JavaScript.
                        It leverages WebGL and the canvas element to create a visually engaging and interactive 3D
                        simulation.
                        The implementation showcases the ability to handle user input for camera control and provides
                        clear
                        instructions to enhance usability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By exploring and interacting with the simulation, users can deepen their understanding of
                        fundamental
                        physics concepts while enjoying an immersive and educational experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, the Newton's Cradle Simulation project combines creativity, technical skill, and
                        educational
                        value to deliver an engaging web-based simulation.

                        The Mandelbrot Visualisation project is a web-based interactive visualisation of the famous
                        Mandelbrot
                        set. The visualisation is implemented using WebGL and JavaScript to provide a dynamic and
                        immersive
                        experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The webpage consists of a canvas element where the Mandelbrot set is rendered. The canvas is
                        dynamically
                        sized to fit the viewport and maintains responsiveness when the window is resized. The
                        visualisation
                        allows users to explore different regions of the Mandelbrot set by panning and zooming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Users can interact with the visualisation using various input methods. The scroll wheel can be
                        used to
                        zoom in and out of the Mandelbrot set, allowing users to explore intricate details. The arrow
                        keys
                        enable panning, allowing users to navigate through the set and focus on specific areas of
                        interest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project also includes a color range slider that allows users to change the color scheme of
                        the
                        visualisation. The color range slider modifies the hues used to represent different areas of the
                        Mandelbrot set, offering a customizable visual experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, an information button is provided to display a modal with instructions on how to
                        interact
                        with the visualisation. The modal provides guidance on using the scroll wheel for zooming, arrow
                        keys
                        for panning, and the color range slider for modifying the color scheme.

                    <p>
                        The Mandelbrot Visualisation project showcases proficiency in WebGL and JavaScript, utilizing
                        shaders
                        and dynamic rendering techniques to create a visually stunning and interactive experience. The
